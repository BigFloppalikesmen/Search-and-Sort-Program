Welcome to the Search and Sort Multi tool

This program was created entirely using Python and offers users multiple search and sort programs to fit their needs.
        1. Linear Search
        2. Bubble Sort
        3. Merge Sort
        4. Binary Search

To test the program, we have provided 3 text files with content in them. Run the program and follow the instructions.
To use your own files for the program, make sure to have the text file and program file in the same directory.

Read the CLI instructions carefully
When performing Complicated algorithms like binary search you would have to make many choices in the CLI
